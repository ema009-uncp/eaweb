                <p>
                    In the late spring and summer of 2020 I was an intern at Emerging 
                    Technology Institute in Red Springs, NC under Enigma Solutions military 
                    contractor. Enigma Solutions was lead by Aaron Carr and was looking for interns
                    to be a part of the team to realize the concept of a project for SOCOM. This
                    project was named "BISKIT" which stood for "Basic Internet Starting Kit".
                    During my time in community college, I was looking to get some work experience
                    under my belt so that I can get a full-time position working in tech. This opportunity
                    revealed itself and I took it. I was hired onto the team to work on the BISKIT project.

                <h3>The BISKIT Project</h2>
                <p>
                    BISKIT was a large kit that housed a number of sensors and gadgets that would connect to 
                    a Raspberry Pi 4. Accomanying the kit was a learning management system style website that
                    teaches users (US SOCOM soldiers) different useful applications that could be made
                    to aid in their opporations as well as including a Python course.

                <p>
                    Before working as an intern at Enigma Solutions, I did not have all the skills associated
                    to build the LMS and teach the courses, however, I learned as I went and picked up many new
                    skills. One of the most useful skills I picked up was learning the basics of Python. I went
                    on to use those skills later to dabble in personal projects as well as ace a needed Python course
                    during my undergrad Computer Science major. I also learned how to organize projects and
                    complete them. BISKIT was a very messy experience at first, but I learned how to manage
                    my tasks quickly and contribute to the team. Lastly, I learned how to showcase projects
                    to expos during my time with Enigma Solutions. This internship gave me a lot of experience
                    with software engineering and product development.

                Throughout my time in community college and four-year university, I had the opportunity to
                add to my skillset with several different projects. Below are the descriptions of projects, large and small,
                that I have completed for different courses.
