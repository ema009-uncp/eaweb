**Projects**
BISKIT:
I previously worked as an intern for a military contractor known as Enigma Solutions. They were
starting a project to teach SOCOM troops how to use basic IOT devices for various applications. The
product included a crate kit that included Raspberry Pi 4's, sensors, and other gadgets that can
connect with the Raspberry Pi computer to do various tasks. Accompanied with the kit was a LMS website
that served as a hub for different courses. These courses included learning material and instructionals
for learning and understanding Python (as the starting course) which would then evolve into other courses
for building various things, such as: radios, distance measurement tools, heat map sensors, and other
applications.

BusinessTracker:
BusinessTracker was my first college project. This application was an ongoing assignment for my 
Software Engineering class where I worked with a team to complete a business management software. This
business management software allowed the user to input basic data such as income and expenses, product
list, inventory, and employee data.

Plutus:
Plutus is a capstone project where I worked with a team to create an offline financial management service
that includes categorized expendeture and income tracking, a budget feature, and a summary page with visual
aids and financial advice powered by our in-house AI engine.

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
